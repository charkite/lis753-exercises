        <p>'What is a doughnut, or donut if you will? Its a small lump of dough,
         which was originally fried in fat. So you can see where the dough
          in doughnut comes from. The nut part is actually a different way of
           saying a small lump. Originally, the name of the treat was dough boy.

        Donut is a simplification of the original spelling, and as such its
         completely in the spirit of the American version of the English
          language. Noah Webster the godfather of American lexicography was a
           strong supporter of spelling reform. If you look at American English
            and British English today youll see that the former has a strong
             tendency to prefer the simpler spellings of words.'</p>
