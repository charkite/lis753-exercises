    <h1>Exercise 06 Stylish Donuts!</h1>
    <p>Who doesnt love to indulge in the occasional doughnut or two? Many times,<br>
       we find ourselves craving the sweet, fried, satisfying taste we get with <br>
       bite of a freshly made Krispy Kreme or Dunkin doughnut. While were<br>
       delighting in the taste of the deep-fried food, do we stop and consider<br>
       how much were hurting our body? Chances are, no. When we fulfill that<br>
       craving and consume the sugary dessert, it could contribute to a number<br>
       of health risks like weight gain and diabetes. Instead, we should try to<br>
       find other tasty, healthier treats to eat.</p>

<blockquote
           <p>Readers Digest Editors (2017) listed doughnuts as one of the<br>
              worst foods you can eat because they contain the unholy trinity<br>
              of unhealthy ingredients trans-fat, sugar, and refined flour.</p>

        <p>'What is a doughnut, or donut if you will? Its a small lump of dough,
         which was originally fried in fat. So you can see where the dough
          in doughnut comes from. The nut part is actually a different way of
           saying a small lump. Originally, the name of the treat was dough boy.

        Donut is a simplification of the original spelling, and as such its
         completely in the spirit of the American version of the English
          language. Noah Webster the godfather of American lexicography was a
           strong supporter of spelling reform. If you look at American English
            and British English today youll see that the former has a strong
             tendency to prefer the simpler spellings of words.'</p>
